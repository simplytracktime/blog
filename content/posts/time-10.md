With so much going on in your life as a teenager, it can be hard to have a healthy schedule and good time management habits, so here are seven tips to help keep your life on track.

1. The first thing to do is to figure out what type of rhythm you have. Everyone has different periods during the day when they are more productive, so working out when these are for you and scheduling your life around them can help increase your productivity.
1. Work out ways to manage your stress. Internal stress is caused by pressures put on you, whereas external stress is caused by deadlines and factors outside. Starting projects and doing the things causing you stress is the best way to deal with external pressure, and practising mindfulness and long walks help with internal stress.
1. Gain an understanding of your priorities. Short-term fun is less beneficial than working towards long-term goals, but in the moment, it can be hard to see it from that point of view. Making dream boards or writing down your aims can be an easy way to consistently remind yourself what is important to you and what you need to do to get there.
1. Start tasks early. Building healthy habits and learning not to procrastinate is an essential skill. While tasks like homework are more manageable at the beginning of high school, they will only get worse and more time-consuming. So learning to be diligent will be beneficial.
1. Set up a calendar and always keep track of the time. Being late and missing appointments/due dates is never fun, so looking at the time on your phone and setting up reminders on your calendar is an easy way to mitigate this.
1. Find ways to limit distractions and tech use. While technology can be helpful with studying and academics, it also comes with many distractions, so finding ways to limit your time looking at distractions can be very beneficial.
1. Do not only make to-do lists. While a to-do list is an excellent way to track what you must do, more is required. You also need to block out time to work on your tasks on the list, which can be done by creating a schedule for yourself.
