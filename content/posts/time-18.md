## Freedom

Going from a highly structured environment like high school or even full time work to university where almost everything is self-motivated (especially with the shift to having recorded lectures) can be a difficult one for many people. So making this change successfully and finding ways to keep your motivation to study up (even when you just want to watch TikTok in bed) takes a lot of effort. But having some easy methods to fall back on that you know work every time for you is going to help a lot.

There are many different types of time management theories and strategies out there. The pompodore, eat that frog, prirotization matrix are just three among a whirlwind of others. Doing personal research and working out the ones that work best for you is my best advice here. Some are going to be more beneficial to certain people, and then others will work well for some subjects but terribly for others.

Another type is to know what time of day you are the most productive in. Some people will work very well early in morning, whereas others will find they do their best work late at night. Working this out will help you stay productive and make the most of each day.

Finally remeber why you are at university. Sometimes the whole university lifestyle can become too overwhelming and the real purpose of why you are there, can get lost amongst assignment, lectures, petty flatmates, and nights out. Every time the motivation feels like it is dropping remeber what the end goal is. University is hard, but you have to remeber why you signed up in the first place and hwo your degree is going to help you accomplish your dreams.
