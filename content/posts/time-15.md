There are lots of great time management apps out there. These can be a small addition to your everyday life which will help you manage your time better. The apps are great for university students in particular but can be suitable for anyone.

The first app is called OWaves. This app has daily wheels you can edit by adding different tasks to fill in every moment of your day. The app works by dragging in each job and customising the task length. Certain waves you can save to use again.

The next app is called Tweek. This app suits people with a simple and minimalistic view of their week. You can add different tasks to the corresponding days of the week; you can colour-code these tasks and move them around as you please. You can check off jobs as you go, and there is also a section for Sunday, so you can add tasks there that you just need to get done, but it only matters so much when you do.

The last app is called Edison. When you open the app, you click the plus sign and can choose what type of goal you want to add. Subgoals take you through the days of the week, so you can add how you will accomplish that weekly goal. The app also has a calendar and review tab.

Different ways of organisation suit different lifestyles and personalities more. So checking out all of these apps to get a gage of what suits you best is highly recommended!
