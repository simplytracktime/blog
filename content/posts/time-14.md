## Planning

Planning is a highly important skill to have, it can benefit your quality of life in many ways. Having a solid planning method is a way to ensure that your plans will be as good as they can be because, as we all know, plans do not always work out.

Keeping that in mind, here is a step-by-step process to ensure your plans work out as often as possible.

The first step is to truly understand where you stand in life. To end up where you want to be, it is important to know where you are starting from. And if you are not honest with yourself about where you stand, then you will almost certainly fail.

The second step is simply making a clear and extremely specific picture/goal of what you want to achieve. The key to this step is to make a clear picture so you understand your goal well.

Step three is where the hard work begins. You must set short, medium and long-term goals to achieve your overarching plan. A short-term goal could be a day or a week, the medium could be a week to two or three, and then long-term goals can be as long as you want, but there must be a deadline. These goals must be specific, realistic, measured and timed.

Step four involves developing the plans. This means deciding what actions you are willing to take each day to achieve the plans. You have to decide what you want to change in your life to get closer to achieving your ideas. At this step, you must be very honest with yourself about what you are willing to do daily. There is no point in setting unrealistic goals for yourself.

Finally, putting your plan into action is the last step. While completing this step, it is important to check in with yourself occasionally to consider how well you are tracking to achieve your deadlines.
