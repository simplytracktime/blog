Time is a fascinating concept. It is a strange thing - intangible yet omnipresent, fleeting yet eternal. Some people would even argue whether it exists or not. Despite this and whether you believe in time, it is indisputable that time is fleeting and making the most of what little we have can feel like a losing game. 

It’s interesting to think about how different cultures and societies perceive time. Some view it as a precious commodity to be savoured and treasured, while others see it as a precious resource to be utilized and maximized. And yet, no matter how we view it, time remains a fundamental part of our existence.

Some people believe by setting goals; they will be able to achieve more. If you have a clear view on what you want to achieve, then all you need to do is go out and achieve it. Setting new years resolutions, having to-do lists, making short and long-term goals and checking off the tasks one by one can make you feel as though you are achieving what you really want to in your life. Others have more of a go-with-the-flow approach where they just take opportunities as they come. Neither approach is better, but the end goal should be satisfaction with a life well lived.

At the end of the day, time is both a mystery and a gift. It’s something we can never truly grasp or control, yet it’s something that shapes our lives in countless ways. So maybe the key to making the most of our time is simply to appreciate it for what it is - a fleeting and yet eternal part of our world.
