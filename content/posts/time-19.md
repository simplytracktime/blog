## Boxes of time

Time boxing is a time management method. It involves setting a fixed amount of time for an activity in advance and then you complete the activity within the given time frame. This method uses Parkinson’s Law - “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”. An example is if you have an essay due in a month, you will subconsciously aim to expand the task meaning that you will not finish the job earlier than the selected month. Using time boxing, you can cut down the time and not let the task fill the time available.

Time blocking and time boxing are two different things. Time blocking means you allocate a period of time to find time to do everything you need. The method of time boxing is assigning time amounts to tasks so that you are limiting the amount of time you spend doing that task. This is to put a strict limit on activities that you worry could take up too much of your time. An example of time boxing would be if you wanted to tidy up your house but want to spend less than an hour doing so, you can limit yourself to 45 minutes of cleaning and then stop no matter how much you have actually managed to do.

This time management technique has five distinct steps:
Find a suitable task
Define your goal
Set the allocated time amount
Work and assess your results
Claim your reward
