## What is time tracking?

What is time tracking? In many scenarios, it is the process of employers logging the hours employees have worked to compensate them correctly and to ensure they are using their time appropriately. An example of this is a time sheet.

However, looking more broadly at time management, time tracking can easily apply outside of everyday work life. It can show a person how much time they spend doing potentially unnecessary activities during the precious hours of their day. A Harvard Business Review showed that the U.S. wastes 7.4 billion dollars daily (a study found this information from people tracking time). Although this study was done concerning work hours, it can be understood in terms of someone's personal life. For example, how productive is scrolling on Instagram?

Tying this back into time management, tracking your time helps you manage your time more effectively. Having a good view of what you have done in a day is an excellent way to reflect on what you have done and how you have wasted or used your time. Leading you to be able to be more efficient with your day.
