## Treating uni like a 9-5.

A way of approaching university that many people promote is treating it like a 9-5 job. A full course load at university amounts to 45 hours a week, equating to a full-time job. Even though you can avoid doing most of this work (I know I could improve at finishing all of my readings), you should still spend the time.

Tracking the amount of time you spend studying should be the first step in trying this approach. Working out how many hours of classwork you have (in terms of tutorials, laboratories and lectures) would be the first thing to do. Then see how many readings, and schedule time to work on assessments. Keeping these hours regular is the next step. Working eight hours a day with scheduled breaks Monday to Friday is the way to approach it. For instance, if your first lecture is at 8:30 am, you are on the clock until 4:30 pm.

This method is beneficial for many reasons. The first reason is it can help to prepare you for what is to come after university. Most people go into working a 9-5 once they graduate, and by using this method, it will be a less jarring shift. Another reason to have a regular schedule is healthy. The absence of routine can often lead to stress and feelings of unmanageability. Therefore by giving yourself a strict schedule, you are supporting your mental and physical health. Finally, instead of leaving everything to the last moment, you will find yourself completing tasks as they arise. Hopefully, removing the need for stressed-out all-nighters trying to finish an essay the day before it is due.
