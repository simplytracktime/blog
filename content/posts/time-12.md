The **static** theory of time and the **dynamic** theory of time are two different theories as to how time works. According to the static theory, time is similar to space, and the passage of time does not exist. Whereas the dynamic theory believes time is very different from space and that the passage of time is actual. Clearly, these two theories are opposing.

It is essential to understand the differences in-depth between these two theories. So five important factors of each theory will be discussed.

In the static theory of time, the universe is divided into four similar dimensions; these make up a four-dimensional manifold called spacetime. Any object located at different times has a different temporal part for every time it is located. A-properties do not exist; all properties can be correctly analysed regarding B-relations. The suitable ontology does not change over time, and it includes objects from all regions of spacetime. There is not a dynamic aspect to time, meaning that it does not pass.

In the dynamic theory of time, the universe is dived into three dimensions of physical space, and time is a different kind of dimension entirely from the spatial dimensions. At every moment an object is located, it is entirely present at that moment. In this theory, genuine A-properties canâ€™t be analysed in terms of B-relations. Temporal facts about the world include facts about what times are past, present and future. Ontology changes over time, and it is always true that the present object exists. Finally, the passage of time is real and a mind-independent phenomenon.
