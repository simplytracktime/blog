## Working

During this university break, I was fortunate enough to get a job working 9-5. The change in schedule from having hour-long lectures and tutorials to an eight-hour workday, where you are working non-stop, was a hard mental shift to make. I was more productive being able to manage my time in a university schedule. Compared to performing this job, there are many moments in a day when I daze off and completely lose focus.

A research study by Andy Molinsky showed that 54% of recent university graduates felt disoriented, confused and dissatisfied when transitioning from their college life to the workplace. The study brought up three main issues: feedback, relationships and accountability. Feedback is due to the difference between clear feedback received on university assignments. The problems with relationships come from the difference in age and the change from university life, where mostly everyone is in the same age range. Finally, accountability relates to how at university, there is only your own life at stake, not anyone else's, which contrasts with work life.

In conclusion, shifting from university to full-time work can be challenging. There are some small things that you can do to support yourself in this change. Take time for yourself during your breaks to reflect on your work, ensure you reach out to other people in the workplace, and also maintain friendships in your personal life, and finally reach out to managers to ask for feedback.
