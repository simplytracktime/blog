5 Habits to Break to Become More Productive: 

These bad habits lead to low productivity. If you are doing any of these, you are inflicting yourself with more stress than necessary. So break them today and free yourself from unneeded stress and effort. 

While multitasking can seem like a good idea at the time, it can lead to starting many tasks but not really finishing any. Instead, try to concentrate on tasks that are important and finish them before starting anything else.

When things start to ramp up, exercise is the first thing to go. But underestimating the difference exercise can make to your motivation and energy levels is very detrimental. Even just 15 minutes of walking every morning can make a huge difference. 

Checking emails or the news repeatedly is just a waste of time. Both can easily be condensed to set time periods. For instance, listen to the daily report as you wake up each morning, and then check your emails when you first sit down at your desk and when you come back from lunch. Obviously, if your job requires you to do so more often, then do that, but usually twice a day at set times should fulfil what is needed. 

Complaining instead of doing can be a huge trap. If something is irritating you, then do something to solve it. Do not just complain about it. 

Making excuses is one that ties into complaining. But do not avoid the things that you really need to get done. A method that can help is ‘eat that frog’ (we have a blog post detailing this). Do the hard tasks first, and then the rest of the day will flow with ease.
