What is time? Looking into a definition of time, we end up with the answer that time is “the progression of events from the past to the present into the future.” (this is the definition provided by physicists.) Some consider it to be a sort of fourth dimension of our reality. While we can not sense it through touch, smell, or taste, we can measure that time has passed. And as we all know, the clock cannot be rewound, so it is an ever-present forward marching concept.

Now that we understand the primary (but somewhat nuanced concept of time), how do we make the most of our fleeting amount (in the grand scheme of things)? Here are five ways to make the most of your time.

Consider your goals and values and rethink how you spend your time concerning them. It is your responsibility to prioritise your time so that you are spending time doing what you want to be.
Add moments of de-stressing into your life. A larger and larger amount of research suggests that adding breaks and downtime moments into every day will help you to become even more productive.
Get more sleep. Lack of sleep deterministically contributes to your productivity. If you want more quality time, getting more sleep will help.
Tom Rath, a scientist and author, recommends exercising early in the morning to boost your energy levels and mood.
Guard your time. Do not feel bad for saying no to things that do not align with the goals you want to achieve—also, saying no to things that simply won’t be worth your time, i.e. an event that would bring more stress than good.
