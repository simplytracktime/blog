      <description>Tomatos? A highly recommended way of managing time is the 45-15 rule, developed by Brett Mckay. This rule dictates that you do 45 minutes of work and then 15 minutes of play. In theory, the 15 minutes allows your brain to relax and decompress from working so that you can be more productive while working in the 45 minutes. This method focuses on preventing boredom and burnout by making your work time more efficient.</description>

In fact, multitasking can actually hurt your time management skills and make you less productive overall.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s why: when you try to do multiple tasks simultaneously, your brain must switch between them constantly.

      <description>Time boxing is a time management method. It involves setting a fixed amount of time for an activity in advance and then you complete the activity within the given time frame. This method uses Parkinson’s Law - “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”. An example is if you have an essay due in a month, you will subconsciously aim to expand the task meaning that you will not finish the job earlier than the selected month.</description>

But having some easy methods to fall back on that you know work every time for you is going to help a lot.</description>

Putting the method into practice is quite simple. Think of the task you would least like to do the next day, maybe just before you go to bed, and then wake up the next morning and complete that task first thing.</description>

      <description>The static theory of time and the dynamic theory of time are two different theories as to how time works. According to the static theory, time is similar to space, and the passage of time does not exist.

Clearly, these two theories are opposing.&#xA;It is essential to understand the differences in-depth between these two theories.</description>

      <description>You may have noticed when completing tasks that it amounts to the time you are given. If you have three hours to write three articles in an exam or three hours to write one article, it will take you all three hours to finish that task. This theory is called Parkinson’s law. Cyril Northcote Parkinson first coined it in an essay for The Economist in 1955. In his essay, he refers to a woman writing a postcard, a task that would take the average person 10 minutes; instead, this woman manages to drag the job out to become her day&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>

      <description>Scheduling and planning are two terms often used in time management; however, these two terms can be confused easily. Planning primarily refers to what and how much must be done, whereas scheduling refers to when operations will be performed and by whom. While they are both different processes, understanding the differences and what makes each term itself helps ensure more efficiency in your time productivity in all situations.&#xA;Planning is creating a plan.</description>

      <description>The getting things done method is a productivity system. The system was developed and explained in David Allen&amp;rsquo;s book “Getting Things Done”. It is a time and productivity management system to help people de-stress their busy lives. It uses calendars and lists to implement the new method, making your life less stressful.&#xA;The base idea is writing down your to-do list, which will help ensure you remember everything necessary. This list will reduce stress as you are not constantly trying to remember what you must do.</description>

      <description>What is time? Looking into a definition of time, we end up with the answer that time is “the progression of events from the past to the present into the future.” (this is the definition provided by physicists.) Some consider it to be a sort of fourth dimension of our reality. While we can not sense it through touch, smell, or taste, we can measure that time has passed. And as we all know, the clock cannot be rewound, so it is an ever-present forward marching concept.</description>

      <description>Time management for people working in creative fields can take more work. This difficulty comes from many places; some reasons could be that they are doing lots but often do not want what they want to be doing or what they count as work—creatives (people working in creative fields, e.g. writers, artists etc.). Performing on big projects that do not have deadlines and are very unstructured can also contribute to their difficulty tracking time.</description>

      <description>During this university break, I was fortunate enough to get a job working 9-5. The change in schedule from having hour-long lectures and tutorials to an eight-hour workday, where you are working non-stop, was a hard mental shift to make. I was more productive being able to manage my time in a university schedule. Compared to performing this job, there are many moments in a day when I daze off and completely lose focus.</description>

      <title>Routine</title>

      <description>A routine is a conscious way of doing things in a repetitive and specific order. Most often, routines are made up of several habits combined to reach a goal. A study published by the National Centre for Biotechnology Information found that good daily habits early on in life lead to a successful life. In contrast, bad habits often lead to negative behaviour, such as dropping out of school.&#xA;Establishing a healthy morning routine is a great way to improve your life and set yourself up for success.</description>

      <title>Treating uni like a 9-5</title>

      <description>A way of approaching university that many people promote is treating it like a 9-5 job. A full course load at university amounts to 45 hours a week, equating to a full-time job. Even though you can avoid doing most of this work (I know I could improve at finishing all of my readings), you should still spend the time.&#xA;Tracking the amount of time you spend studying should be the first step in trying this approach.</description>

      <title>What is time tracking?</title>

      <description>What is time tracking? In many scenarios, it is the process of employers logging the hours employees have worked to compensate them correctly and to ensure they are using their time appropriately. An example of this is a time sheet.&#xA;However, looking more broadly at time management, time tracking can easily apply outside of everyday work life. It can show a person how much time they spend doing potentially unnecessary activities during the precious hours of their day.</description>
