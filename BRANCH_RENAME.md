# Branch Rename: Master to Main

This repository is prepared for renaming the `master` branch to `main`.

## Changes Made

- Updated `.github/workflows/hugo.yml` to reference `main` branch instead of `master`
- Verified no other references to `master` branch exist in the codebase

## Next Steps (Repository Admin Required)

To complete the branch rename, a repository administrator needs to:

1. **Navigate to GitHub Repository Settings**
   - Go to https://github.com/simplytracktime/blog/settings
   - Click on "Branches" in the left sidebar

2. **Rename the Default Branch**
   - Find the "Default branch" section
   - Click the pencil icon next to `master`
   - Change the branch name from `master` to `main`
   - Click "Rename branch"

3. **Update Local Repositories**
   After the rename, anyone with local clones should update their local repository:
   ```bash
   git branch -m master main
   git fetch origin
   git branch -u origin/main main
   git remote set-head origin -a
   ```

4. **Update Any External References**
   - Check any external CI/CD systems
   - Update documentation that references the master branch
   - Update any branch protection rules if they exist

## Verification

After the rename is complete, verify that:
- The GitHub workflow triggers correctly on pushes to the `main` branch
- GitHub Pages deployment works if configured
- All external integrations work correctly

## Cleanup

Once the rename is complete and verified, this documentation file can be removed.
